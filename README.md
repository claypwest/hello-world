Moving the world forward, two steps at a time
Currently heavily involved with the zOS Mainframe platform.  Over the past several years my main objective has been automating the Mainframe platform.  Unbeknown to most, automation on the Mainframe is no different than on any other platform.  The goal of automation is to free up skilled resources to continue to better the world, further leading to stacked automation, with the goal of unlimited harmony one day.  Together all things are possible. 
My biggest interests are (in no particular order):  Artificial Intelligence, big data and of course - automation.
